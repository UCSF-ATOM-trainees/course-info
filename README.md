# UCSF-ATOM Trainee Program Independent Study

## Overview
The trainee program academic year will consist of a two-semester capstone course led by Dr. Amanda Paulson in collaboration with a UC Merced faculty member, Dr. David Ardell. Students will learn to build chemistry focused machine learning models using Python packages and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) HPC system. They will use their models to select candidate compounds for further study in the lab. Students will attend a national conference on chemistry and AI in the spring and present their work in a poster or talk.

## Expected learning outcomes
Throughout the two semesters, students will learn end-to-end machine learning (ML) modeling and analysis primarily through the use of [AMPL](https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL). In addition, they will apply their models to a generative design problem, contribute to the AMPL codebase, and learn how to work on a high performance computing system.

- Data manipulation and basic EDA with special attention paid to formatting data for ingestion by ML algorithms using pandas, numpy, base python, matplotlib, seaborn
- Computational chemistry basics: translating compounds to numerical inputs for analysis and ML using rdkit, mordred, MOE, UMAP, AMPL
- RF, XGBoost, Gaussian Process and Neural networks: basic understanding and how to implement for QSAR using sklearn, deepchem, gpytorch, AMPL
- Hyperparameter optimization: Use FLUX based HPC system for large compute jobs using FLUX, bash, AMPL
- Advanced topics: Model performance analysis & domain of applicability using AMPL
- Advanced topics: uncertainty quantification using AMPL, sklearn, deepchem
- Advanced topics: feature importance using AMPL, sklearn
- Advanced topics: generative design using AMPL, GLO, LLMs
- Advanced topics: software development using AMPL, github

## Deliverables
By the end of the year, students will have a GitHub portfolio outlining their projects including jupyter notebooks with reusable code, FLUX and SLURM based scripts for interacting with HPC systems, a model zoo and production-level models built from their datasets, written documentation and data visualizations for their projects, and authorship in a living software project. Further, students will create academic and industry versions of their resume that reflect these skills.    

## Student expectations
Besides attending a weekly meeting with Dr. Paulson, students are expected to devote 10-15 hours of independent time to the project, which will serve as a 3-credit upper level course. Independent work will include:
- Read papers, chapters and complete Coursera course modules
- Modify jupyter notebooks to apply to your own datasets and run them on LLNLâ€™s HPC system 
- Write new code to further analyze their NEK-specific results
- Maintain written documentation and visualizations of project like a lab notebook
- Maintain an updated github repo with regular pushes
- Work together to troubleshoot, share data and results, build multitask models, and work on other advanced topics
- Attend and present at ATOM meetings to interact with the Open Data and Models team & NEK team
- Attend and present at a national conference in Spring 2025
